# Back to studying and an introduction to PySpark

I had taken a break from studying programming, but now I’m back. So let’s go with today’s study:
I learned the basics of a framework called PySpark. It’s used for Big Data, and since Python is professional-level, learning it will be great because it can open doors for me in both data analysis and back-end development. I watched three videos about this topic and explored some projects and code from other people in a programmers’ Discord channel.
