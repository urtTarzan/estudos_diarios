**DAILY STUDY**

Let's go! This is my first post about my daily study routine. Today I learned about middleware, watched some videos going deep into this topic,
did some tests with middlewares like authorization and processing time, and wrote everything in my personal study notebook.
Also, I watched some videos about CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, I think that's it).

PS:
I used this code for training and learned so much. Tomorrow, I will learn more about it and move on to something else. Pytest is on my list, and maybe I will start with that.
