# etec homework /django project
Today I saw some job postings on LinkedIn and remembered that I have a front-end homework assignment from my ETEC class.
So I decided to do the front-end quickly with an AI like ChatGPT and focus on the back-end with Django.
(The back-end wasnâ€™t required,but I made it anyway just to put it on my GitHub and learn more lol =) )
