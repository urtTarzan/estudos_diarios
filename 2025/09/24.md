# etec homework /django project
Today I saw some job postings on LinkedIn and remembered that I have a front-end homework assignment from my ETEC class.
So I decided to do the front-end quickly with an AI like ChatGPT and focus on the back-end with Django.
(The back-end wasnâ€™t required,but I made it anyway just to put it on my GitHub and learn more lol =) )

So now letâ€™s start creating the front-end (I hate front-end, someone help me ðŸ˜…). 
First model: ```I accidentally deleted the first model I created, so letâ€™s start it from scratch.```
