# etec homework /django project
Today I saw some job postings on LinkedIn and remembered that I have a front-end homework assignment from my ETEC class.
So I decided to do the front-end quickly with an AI like ChatGPT and focus on the back-end with Django.
(The back-end wasn’t required,but I made it anyway just to put it on my GitHub and learn more lol =) )

So now let’s start creating the front-end (I hate front-end, someone help me 😅).   

## First model:
```I accidentally deleted the first model I created, so let’s start it from scratch.```
## final:

So I wrote the project and modeled the system, creating the first app (the other one comes later) and put the first HTML there just for testing. Tomorrow I’ll do a lot more things, but today I’m going to have my dinner and then sleep. Bye bye! 🍽️💤
