Hi everyone! Today I continued my homework. There will be a huge conference about this project, so Iâ€™m very excited and happy to work on it.
Today I looked at some things about React and I will learn it in the future. For today, I created the navigation bar and fixed some issues, like images and colors.
The code is in this repository, and the image below shows how this project looks so far.
